# Collectiv

> Social infrastructure for collector communities — trading cards, comics, retro gaming, and beyond.

Collectiv is a mobile-first app where collectors can catalog their cards, showcase them, buy and sell locally, follow other collectors, join community groups, attend events, and discover nearby sellers and vendors on a live map. Built with React Native + Expo and Supabase.

**Current version:** 1.01  
**Build year:** 2026 (validation + distribution via Expo Go / Android APK)  
**App Store release:** 2027

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | React Native + Expo SDK 54 | Supports Expo Go on App Store for free testing in 2026 |
| Routing | Expo Router (file-based) | Typed routes enabled |
| Language | TypeScript (strict mode) | No `any` except router cast workarounds |
| Backend | Supabase | Postgres + Auth + Storage + Realtime — one vendor, four needs |
| Server state | TanStack Query v5 | Cache, stale-time, optimistic updates |
| Client state | Zustand v5 | UI flags only; auth is Context |
| Auth state | React Context + `onAuthStateChange` | Never navigate imperatively after auth events |
| Maps | react-native-maps | Apple Maps on iOS (no key needed in Expo Go); Google Maps on Android (API key needed for production) |
| Location | expo-location | Foreground permission only |
| Image storage | Supabase Storage | Paths in DB, URLs resolved at query time |
| Styling | StyleSheet | No NativeWind yet — Phase 10 polish decision |
| Forms | React Hook Form + Zod | Phase 2+ forms |

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and **npm** 10+
- **Expo CLI** — `npm install -g expo-cli` (or use `npx expo` everywhere)
- **Expo Go** on your iPhone (scan QR from terminal) OR
- **Android device/emulator** for APK testing
- A **Supabase** project (free tier is sufficient through validation)
- **Git**

Optional for Android APK:
- **EAS CLI** — `npm install -g eas-cli`
- **Expo account** (free) — `eas login`

---

## Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/collectiv.git
   cd collectiv
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create the environment file**

   Copy the example and fill in your Supabase credentials:

   ```bash
   # Create .env in the project root (it is gitignored)
   ```

   `.env` contents:

   ```env
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   ```

   Find these in your Supabase dashboard under **Settings → API**.

---

## Running the App

```bash
# Start the Expo development server
npx expo start
```

In the terminal output:
- Press **i** to open in iOS Simulator
- Press **a** to open in Android Emulator
- Scan the **QR code** with the Expo Go app on your phone (iPhone or Android)

> **Note:** All native modules (react-native-maps, expo-location, expo-camera, etc.) are bundled in Expo Go — no custom build needed for testing.

### Android APK (for sharing with testers)

```bash
# Build a signed APK via EAS
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

This uploads to Expo's build servers and produces a downloadable `.apk`. Free on the Expo free tier (limited builds per month).

---

## Database — Supabase Setup

### 1. Create a Supabase project

Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) → New Project. Choose a region close to your users.

### 2. Enable PostGIS

Supabase Dashboard → **Database → Extensions** → search for **PostGIS** → Enable.

> PostGIS is required for the Maps tab (Phase 8). The geography columns were added to the schema from day one, but the extension must be enabled before running migrations.

### 3. Enable Realtime on the relevant tables

After running all migrations, go to **Database → Replication** and ensure these tables have Realtime enabled:

- `messages` (Phase 3 — live chat)
- `comments` (Phase 4 — live comments)
- `reactions` (Phase 4 — live likes)
- `notifications` (Phase 4 — notification badge)
- `event_rsvps` (Phase 7 — RSVP counts)
- `profiles` (Phase 9 — presence / online dot)

> Migration 0009 enables Realtime on `profiles` via SQL. The others are enabled automatically by the Realtime subscription calls in the app hooks.

### 4. Storage buckets

The app uses a single bucket called `card-photos` for all images (card fronts/backs, group covers, event covers, vendor banners/logos).

Create it in **Storage → New Bucket**:
- Name: `card-photos`
- Public: **Yes** (images are served via CDN URLs)

---

## Running Migrations

Migrations are plain SQL files in `supabase/migrations/`. Supabase does not track them — the repo is the source of truth. Run them in order in the **SQL Editor** (Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → New query → paste → Run).

| File | Phase | What it deploys |
|---|---|---|
| `0001_phase1_profiles_collections.sql` | 1 | `profiles`, `collections`, `handle_new_user()` trigger, PostGIS extension, all Phase 8/9 columns added upfront |
| `0002_phase2_cards_photos.sql` | 2 | `cards`, `card_photos`, Storage RLS policies |
| `0003_phase3_marketplace_chat.sql` | 3 | `listings`, `conversations`, `conversation_participants`, `messages`, `find_or_create_conversation()` |
| `0004_phase4_social.sql` | 4 | `follows`, `feed_events`, `comments`, `reactions`, `notifications`, feed/notification triggers |
| `0005_phase5_groups.sql` | 5 | `groups`, `group_members`, `group_posts`, polymorphic comments/reactions extended to `group_post` |
| `0006_phase6_vendors.sql` | 6 | `vendor_profiles`, `vendor_reviews` |
| `0007_phase7_events.sql` | 7 | `events`, `event_rsvps`, RSVP notification trigger, Realtime on `event_rsvps` |
| `0008_phase8_maps.sql` | 8 | GIST spatial indexes, `map_pins()`, `update_pickup_location()`, `update_vendor_location()` RPCs |
| `0009_phase9_presence.sql` | 9 | Realtime on `profiles`, `active_collector_count()` RPC, `map_pins()` updated to require `show_on_nearby_map = true` |

**Run them in order — each migration assumes the previous one is deployed.**

> If you see `ERROR: type "geometry" does not exist` when running migration 0008 or 0009, your PostGIS extension may be installed in the `extensions` schema instead of `public`. All functions use `set search_path = public, extensions` to handle this, but you must have the extension enabled first (see step 2 above).

---

## Distribution

### iPhone — Expo Go (no Apple Developer account needed)

1. Install **Expo Go** from the App Store on your iPhone.
2. Run `npx expo start` on your machine.
3. Open the Camera app and scan the QR code in the terminal.
4. The app loads over your local network.

> Both devices must be on the same Wi-Fi network. If that's not possible, use `npx expo start --tunnel` (requires `@expo/ngrok`).

### Android — APK sideload

1. Build: `eas build --platform android --profile preview`
2. Download the `.apk` from the Expo dashboard.
3. Enable **Install unknown apps** on the Android device.
4. Transfer and install the APK.

### Android Google Maps API Key

The Maps tab uses Google Maps on Android. In Expo Go this works without a key, but a production EAS build requires:

1. Create a project in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Enable **Maps SDK for Android**
3. Create an API key (restrict to your app's package name)
4. Add to `app.json`:

```json
"android": {
  "config": {
    "googleMaps": {
      "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    }
  }
}
```

### Phase 8 — Maps / Local Discovery

**Migration:** `0008_phase8_maps.sql`

> All geography columns (`pickup_location`, `business_location`, `events.location`) were added to the schema in Phases 1/6/7 — no new tables, only indexes + RPC functions.

**What it includes:**
- **Maps tab**: full-screen MapView (Apple Maps on iOS, Google Maps on Android)
- Three pin types with distinct colors and icons:
  - **Seller** (coral) — collectors who have opted into the map with a pickup location
  - **Vendor** (teal) — vendor storefronts with a business location set
  - **Event** (purple) — upcoming events with a location pinned
- Filter chips: All / Sellers / Vendors / Events
- Tap a pin → bottom sheet with image, title, subtitle, type badge, "View" button
- "My location" FAB — requests foreground permission, pans map to GPS position
- **Pickup location setup** (screen 35): triggered after first listing creation if no location is set; drag-map pin UI, "Use my location" button with reverse-geocode city prefill, travel radius chips (5/10/25/50 km)
- Seller's `pickup_city` displayed in listing detail so buyers see the meet-up area at a glance
- **Vendor business location** setter in Settings → Vendor / business → LOCATION row

**Backend RPCs:**
- `map_pins()` — unified query returning all three pin types with lat/lng extracted from PostGIS geography
- `update_pickup_location(lat, lng, city, radius_km)` — writes `profiles.pickup_location`
- `update_vendor_location(lat, lng)` — writes `vendor_profiles.business_location`
- GIST spatial indexes on all geography columns

**New packages:** `react-native-maps`, `expo-location`

**Key files:**

> All presence columns (`last_seen_at`, `presence_status`, `broadcast_presence`, `broadcast_approximate_location`, `show_on_nearby_map`) were in `profiles` from Phase 1 — no new tables.

**What it includes:**
- **Presence tracking**: `PresenceProvider` wraps the app and listens to React Native `AppState` changes
  - App → foreground: stamps `last_seen_at = now()`, sets `presence_status = 'online'` (throttled to one write/minute)
  - App → background: sets `presence_status = 'offline'`
- **Online dot on public profiles**: teal dot on the Avatar when `broadcast_presence = true` and `last_seen_at` is within 5 minutes
- **"X collectors active" counter on Home tab**: green dot + count of opted-in collectors active in the last 30 minutes; refreshes every 2 minutes
- **Privacy settings screen** (Settings → Privacy):
  - **Show my online status** — `broadcast_presence` — lets others see the green dot
  - **Show me on the collector map** — `show_on_nearby_map` — your pickup pin appears on the Maps tab (off by default; no seller pins appear until users opt in)
  - **Share location with followers** — `broadcast_approximate_location`
  - All toggles save immediately on change; revert on error
- Map seller pins now require `show_on_nearby_map = true` (opt-in, not opt-out)
- Realtime enabled on `profiles` table for live `last_seen_at` updates

**Key files:**
- `providers/presence-provider.tsx` — AppState listener
- `hooks/use-presence.ts` — `isProfileOnline()` utility + `useActiveCollectorCount()`
- `components/ui/avatar.tsx` — `online` prop with green dot overlay
- `app/settings/privacy.tsx` — privacy toggles
- `app/profile/[id].tsx` — online dot on public profiles

---

### Phase 10 — Polish & Seed Data

**Planned features:**
- Onboarding tour (4–5 slide overlay for new users, stored in `profiles.onboarding_completed_at`)
- Password reset flow (Supabase magic link)
- Profile avatar photo upload (currently initials-only)
- Seed data: featured vendors, sample events, and demo groups for cold-start discovery
- Privacy policy + Terms of Service (using a free generator)
- EAS Build configuration for production Android APK and iOS IPA
- App icon, splash screen, and brand assets finalized
- Error boundary screens
- Empty state illustrations
- Analytics integration (TBD)

---

## 2027 Roadmap (Next Year)

The following phases are designed but explicitly deferred out of the 2026 build year.

### Phase 11 — Multi-Category Expansion

**Goal:** Expand beyond trading cards to comics, retro gaming, vinyl records, and other collectibles without schema migrations — the JSONB `metadata` column on `cards` makes this a UI-only change.

**Planned features:**
- Category picker on Add Card (Trading Cards / Comics / Retro Gaming / Vinyl / Other)
- Category-specific metadata fields rendered from a config map:
  - Comics: issue number, publisher, grade (CGC/CBCS), variant cover
  - Retro Gaming: platform, region, CIB/loose, label variant
  - Vinyl: label, pressing, matrix, condition (Goldmine standard)
  - Trading Cards: existing fields (set, condition, etc.)
- Marketplace filter by category
- Search across all categories
- Category-specific showcase layouts on public profiles
- Migration: `card_categories` lookup table for admin-managed vocabulary

---

### Phase 12 — App Store Release

**Goal:** Submit to Apple App Store (iOS) and Google Play Store (Android).

**Planned work:**
- Apple Developer Program enrollment ($99/year)
- Google Play Developer account ($25 one-time)
- App Store listing: screenshots, description, keywords, age rating
- Privacy policy URL (required by both stores)
- EAS Submit configuration for automated store uploads
- TestFlight beta for iOS (up to 10,000 testers)
- Production Supabase plan upgrade (free tier limits: 500MB DB, 1GB Storage, 50,000 MAU)
- Custom domain for Supabase project
- Performance profiling and FlashList migration (FlatList → FlashList for 60fps on long lists)

---

### Phase 13 — Payments & Offers

**Goal:** Optional in-app coordination layer for trades and offers. Not real payments — still no money moves through the app.

**Planned features:**
- Offer system: buyer makes an offer on a listing → seller accepts/counters/declines
- Trade proposals: offer card X for card Y
- Offer notification thread in chat (structured messages alongside free-form chat)
- "Price history" on a card (track price changes over time)
- Saved searches with push notifications ("alert me when a Charizard base set is listed under $500")

---

### Phase 14 — Push Notifications

**Goal:** Real push notifications to replace the in-app-only badge system.

**Planned work:**
- Expo Push Notifications service (handles APNs + FCM)
- `push_tokens` table: store per-device token linked to user
- Notification preferences (per-type opt-out): follows, likes, comments, group posts, events, offers
- Notification grouping (3 likes → "3 people liked your card")
- Deep link handling: tap notification → correct screen, even from cold start
- Expo EAS Update for OTA code pushes (bug fixes without store re-review)

---

### Phase 15 — Social Auth & OAuth

**Goal:** Add Google and Apple sign-in alongside the existing email/password flow.

**Planned work:**
- Supabase OAuth providers: Google, Apple
- Apple Sign In (required by App Store if any other OAuth is offered)
- Account linking: allow a user to add Google to their existing email account
- Expo AuthSession for the OAuth flow
- Profile migration: preserve existing data when linking accounts

---

### Phase 16 — Advanced Vendor Features

**Goal:** Paid vendor tier and advanced discovery.

**Planned features:**
- Featured vendor placement (paid tier — manual flag `is_featured` already in schema)
- Vendor analytics dashboard: listing views, profile visits, message volume, review score trend
- Bulk listing import (CSV upload)
- Inventory management: low-stock alerts, bulk price update
- Vendor-to-vendor wholesale offers
- Convention booth mode: display QR code for buyers to scan and open the storefront

---

### Phase 17 — Community Moderation

**Goal:** Give group owners and platform admins tools to keep communities healthy.

**Planned features:**
- Group owner can pin posts, remove members, delete posts
- Report system: flag a listing / post / user → routes to admin queue
- Block list (schema already has the `blocked_accounts` placeholder in Settings)
- Mute keywords in feed
- Auto-moderation: ML-based image flagging for inappropriate card images (Supabase Edge Function + external API)
- Platform admin dashboard (separate web app, not in the mobile build)

## Architecture Decisions

- **No App Store in 2026.** Distribution via Expo Go (iPhone) and EAS APK (Android). Apple Developer enrollment deferred to 2027.
- **No in-app payments.** Marketplace is buyer–seller coordination only — Facebook Marketplace style. No money moves through the app.
- **Schema designed upfront, deployed phase by phase.** Phase 8/9 columns live in the `profiles` table from migration 0001 — avoids risky migrations once real users exist.
- **Migrations as text files, not tracked by Supabase.** The repo (`supabase/migrations/`) is the source of truth. Run them manually in order.
- **Auth flows are state-driven, not navigation-driven.** Never call `router.push` after sign-in/sign-out — let `onAuthStateChange` + layout guards handle it.
- **Money as integer cents, never floats.** `price_cents INTEGER` everywhere. Currency in a separate column.
- **Text fields over Postgres enums.** `genre`, `condition`, `event_type` are plain text with CHECK constraints. Enum migrations are painful on live data.
- **Polymorphic comments/reactions via `target_type` + `target_id`.** No FK enforcement — integrity maintained at the app layer. Covers: `listing`, `card`, `group_post`, `event`.
- **Storage paths in DB, not URLs.** CDN URLs change; paths don't. URLs resolved at render time via `cardPhotoUrl(path)`.
- **All presence settings default to OFF.** `broadcast_presence`, `show_on_nearby_map`, and `broadcast_approximate_location` are opt-in. No seller pins appear on the map until a user enables "Show me on the collector map" in Privacy settings.

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Notes |
|---|---|
| Android Maps need a Google Maps API key | Works in Expo Go without a key; required for production APK. See [Distribution](#distribution). |
| No push notifications | In-app badges only. Push notifications are Phase 14 (2027). |
| Avatar = initials only | Photo upload for profile avatars is Phase 10 polish. Card photos are real. |
| No password reset | The Settings link exists but is inert. Planned for Phase 10. |
| No app store listing | Both stores require Phase 12 work. |
| Seller pins require map opt-in | Users must enable "Show me on the collector map" in Settings → Privacy. Map will show no seller pins until users opt in. |
| Google Maps API key for Android production | Add `android.config.googleMaps.apiKey` to `app.json` before building the APK. |
| `pickup_location` is approximate | The location stored is where the user drops the pin — it's their preferred meet-up area, not a precise home address. |
